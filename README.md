This readme file provides an overview of the application and instructions on how to use it.

## Features

The Student Care Application offers the following features:

1. **Student Information:** Allows you to store and manage student details such as name, age, and parent information.

2. **Registration Renewal:** Tracks the annual registration renewal of students, ensuring that their registration is up to date.
